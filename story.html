       <h1>Loneliness in young adults is not unique to our generation.</h1>
       
        <p> When first-year clinical psychology graduate student Nina Kougan started graduate school at Northwestern University, she noticed that she connected with her friends and family less often despite being based in Chicago, close to where she goes to school.
        </p>
  
        <p> "There’s that pressure to just focus on your career because that’s what’s going to set the stage for your life. Sometimes your social relationships can be the first thing to go," Kougan said.
        </p>
  
        <p> If you’ve ever experienced a breakup or falling-out with friends, you might know that weakening social relationships can often come with feelings of loneliness. U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murphy shined a spotlight on loneliness when he declared it a national issue in spring 2023 in a <a href ="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/connection/index.html" target = "_blank" >report</a> titled “Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation." </p>

        <p> The report noted that all adults, and especially young people, are spending less time together than they were two decades ago. It also pointed out dangerous physical impacts of loneliness, including increased risk for heart disease, stroke and developing dementia for older adults. </p>

        <p>First-year clinical psychology graduate student Claire Bertrand researching psychotic disorders at Northwestern University defined loneliness as feeling “emotionally withdrawn” and disconnected from others. Kougan, who is studying the neuroscience behind affect in adolescents, also saw part of chronic loneliness to be struggling to know how to reconnect once social relationships are lost.

     <p>In addition to physical outcomes of loneliness, Bertrand and Kougan underscored its relationship with mental health disorders, especially with internalizing disorders like depression. Experiencing mental health crises or even just receiving a diagnosis can be isolating, and symptoms of the disorder might cause someone to struggle reconnecting with others, feeding back into the disorder itself, Kougan said. 
    </p>

    <p>“You enter this negative cycle where you don’t have the energy or motivation to do things. Even if you did have people to see, you might not be in the mood to go socialize,” Kougan said of people with depression specifically. 
    </p>

    <p> Evidence shows that there’s a general pattern of loneliness throughout the adult lifespan across generations. One research <a href = "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9727057/#Sec9" target = "_blank"> study</a> found that emotional loneliness follows a U-shaped distribution, peaking in early and late adulthood and dipping in middle adulthood. Bertrand noted that, for those attending higher education, the transition out of college can be difficult, as you tend to lose the structures that allow for daily interaction with peers. </p>

    <p>“When you enter the workplace, you have to put in more effort to maintain friendships. It’s not just like ‘Oh, I’m seeing this friend at school’ or ‘Oh, I’m gonna see this friend at soccer later,’” Bertrand said. 
    </p>

    <p>Bertrand added that adolescence and even young adulthood is a generally a critical period for social sensitivity, when people tend to attribute the most value to social networks and rely on these networks to define their social roles. The years after college might represent a period when people still heavily value social connection but suddenly lose the opportunities to form and maintain them. 
    </p>

    <p>Data from the <a href = "https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Lack-of-Social-Connection/mnaa-qctp/about_data" target = "_blank">CDC</a> surveying Americans on social support, loneliness and social isolation found that the 18-29 age group consistently reported the highest percentage of loneliness throughout nine months in 2024.

    <p>With headlines warning of <a href ="https://www.wired.com/story/ditch-screens-end-global-friendship-recession/" target = "_blank">global friendship recessions</a> and <a href = "https://www.npr.org/2023/05/02/1173418268/loneliness-connection-mental-health-dementia-surgeon-general" target = "_blank">loneliness epidemics</a>, it’s worth questioning whether internal feelings of loneliness have truly increased over time since before the COVID pandemic, even with objective factors, like in-person time spent with others, decreasing. 
    </p>

    <p>Some empirical evidence finds mixed results to this question. One <a href = "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9640887/#Sec2" target = "_blank">review</a> from 2023 found that a meta-analysis that drew from people all over the world found a significant increase in loneliness only in North America, while another focusing on the U.S. reported decreases in average loneliness in high school and college students.</p>

    <p>“Epidemic is kind of a buzzword,” Kougan said. 
    </p>

    <p>She emphasized that it’s natural for people to become less social as they get older. She also noted that there’s unclear evidence supporting the role that social media plays in loneliness in this generation, as social media can both help people connect online and keep them from building in-person relationships. In fact, the same 2023 <a href = "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9640887/#Sec2" target = "_blank">study</a> claims that the “link between the digitalization of social interactions and loneliness seems weak.”

    <p>Instead, Kougan points to the distinct path in our culture from education to the workforce and the value placed on career that contributes more to patterns of loneliness.
    </p>
      
    <p> “You’re expected to make more time for work, and that’s supposed to be the focus of your life. In the structure our society and culture has created, it doesn’t leave a lot of room to be social, especially as you get out of those bubbles of formal education settings,” Kougan said. 
    </p>

    <p>Young adults experiencing loneliness should know that this could be something naturally happening as you age or go through changes in life circumstances. Yet, there are still ways to dedicate energy to your social relationships to tackle feelings of loneliness, starting with prioritizing work-life balance and focusing on joining the communities around you.

            <p> To create the data visualization, I used the CDC's <a href = "https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Lack-of-Social-Connection/mnaa-qctp/about_data" > dataset</a> on Lack of Social Connections. Using Google Sheets, I filtered the "Indicator" column to just show respondents who marked that they "usually or always feel lonely," as well as the "Group" column to filter out other demographics like sex, education level or state to just show age group. I copied this filtered data into a separate sheet and created a pivot table to reorganize and extract certain variables. I put the collection period start dates in rows, the sub age groups in columns and the corresponding percentage of respondents in values. I uploaded this pivot table into Flourish to create the multiple line chart, separated by age group. </p>
