       <h1>The loneliness epidemic might not be as new as we think.</h1>
       
        <p> When first year clinical psychology graduate student Nina Kougan started graduate school at Northwestern, she noticed that she connects with her friends and family less often despite being based in Chicago.</p>
  
        <p> "Social relationships can be the first to go...," Kougan said.  </p>
  
        <p> A weakening of social relationships can often contribute to feelings of loneliness, which the U.S. surgeon general declared a national issue in spring 2023 in a <a href ="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/connection/index.html">report</a> titled â€œOur Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation." </p>

            <p> To create the data visualization, I used the CDC's <a href = "https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Lack-of-Social-Connection/mnaa-qctp/about_data" > dataset</a> on Lack of Social Connections. Using Google Sheets, I filtered the "Indicator" column to just show respondents who marked that they "usually or always feel lonely," as well as the "Group" column to filter out other demographics like sex, education level or state to just show age group. I copied this filtered data into a separate sheet and created a pivot table to reorganize and extract certain variables. I put the collection period start dates in rows, the sub age groups in columns and the corresponding percentage of respondents in values. I uploaded this pivot table into Flourish to create the multiple line chart, separated by age group. </p>
